Valheim modded with BepInExPack courtesy of Thunderstore.io

IMPORTANT: Make sure you have unzip installed on the machine Puffer is being hosted on.
You can get that with `sudo apt unzip` if you dont already.

How to install mods:
The modpages on Thunderstore will usually have instructions - however the usual way is as follows.

1. Unpack the downloaded server mod zip (client side mods should be avoided)
2. Upload the dll files and folders to the BepInEx/plugins folder on the server (zip them if theres too many) 
3. Profit! You should see them loaded somwhere in the server start logs around all the BepInEx text

NOTE: The BepInExPack download can take up to 10-15 minutes sometimes. This is on Thunderstore and not something you can change but it *will* download.

NOTE: There will be *many* errors during server install. As long as it says 'server installed' at the end they can safely be ignored
